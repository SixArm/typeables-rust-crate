//! 
//! The second is a unit of time.
//! 
//! It is a base unit in the International System of Units (SI).
//! 
//! The SI unit symbol is s.
//!
//! The second is commonly understood as 1‚ÅÑ60 of a minute. Analog clocks and
//! watches often have sixty tick marks on their faces, representing seconds
//! (and minutes), and a "second hand" to mark the passage of time in seconds.
//! Digital clocks and watches often have a two-digit seconds counter. 
//! 
//! The second is also part of several other units of measurement like metres
//! per second for speed, metres per second per second for acceleration, and
//! cycles per second for frequency.
