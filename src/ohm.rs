//! The ohm is a unit of  of electrical resistance.
//! 
//! It is a derived unit in the International System of Units (SI).
//!
//! The SI unit symbol is Î©.
//!
//! The ohm named after German physicist Georg Ohm. 
//! 
//! Various empirically derived standard units for electrical resistance were
//! developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, and the British
//! Association for the Advancement of Science proposed a unit derived from
//! existing units of mass, length and time, and of a convenient scale for
//! practical work as early as 1861. As of 2020, the definition of the ohm is
//! expressed in terms of the quantum Hall effect.
