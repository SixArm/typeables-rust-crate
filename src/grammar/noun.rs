/// Noun

/// https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun
///
/// A noun is a word that functions as the name of a specific object or set of
/// objects, such as living creatures, places, actions, qualities, states of
/// existence, or ideas. However, noun is not a semantic category, so it cannot
/// be characterized in terms of its meaning. Thus, actions and states of
/// existence can also be expressed by verbs, qualities by adjectives, and
/// places by adverbs. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part
/// of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a
/// clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.
